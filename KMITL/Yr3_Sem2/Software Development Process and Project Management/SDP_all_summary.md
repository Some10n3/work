## **üìå Software Development Models**  

| **Model** | **Description** |
|----------|---------------|
| **Waterfall** | A **linear, sequential** approach where each phase (Requirement ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Deployment) must be completed before moving to the next. Best for projects with **stable requirements** and minimal changes. |
| **V-Model (Verification & Validation Model)** | An **extension of Waterfall** where each development phase has a corresponding **testing phase**. Often used in **safety-critical industries** like healthcare, aerospace, and finance. |
| **Unified Process (UP)** | A **structured, iterative framework** where development progresses in **phases** (Inception, Elaboration, Construction, Transition). Balances flexibility with a **well-defined structure**. Suitable for large enterprise systems. |
| **Spiral Model** | Focuses on **risk assessment & iteration**. Each cycle consists of **planning, risk analysis, development, and evaluation**. Best for **high-risk projects** where requirements evolve. |
| **Prototyping** | A **proof-of-concept** model where a **working prototype** is built before full-scale development. Helps gather feedback early but can lead to **scope creep** if overused. |
| **Agile** | A **flexible, iterative approach** that emphasizes **customer collaboration, working software, and responsiveness to change**. Ideal for dynamic projects where requirements evolve frequently. |
| **RAD (Rapid Application Development)** | A **fast-paced development model** that emphasizes **prototyping, iterative development, and quick user feedback**. Best for projects needing **rapid delivery with evolving requirements**. |

## **üìå Agile Methodologies**  

| **Method** | **Description** |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Scrum** | A structured Agile framework where work is divided into **fixed-length Sprints (1‚Äì4 weeks)**. Teams hold **Daily Stand-ups**, maintain a **Product Backlog**, and conduct **Sprint Planning, Reviews, and Retrospectives**. Best for **team-based product development**. |
| **Kanban** | A **visual workflow management method** where tasks move through **a Kanban board (Backlog ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Done)**. No fixed iterations, work is **pulled** as capacity allows. Used in **DevOps, maintenance, and support teams**. |
| **Scrumban** | A **hybrid of Scrum and Kanban**, combining Scrum‚Äôs **structured planning** with Kanban‚Äôs **flexibility**. Ideal for **long-term projects** with changing priorities. |
| **Extreme Programming (XP)** | Focuses on **high-quality coding**, **continuous feedback**, **pair programming**, **test-driven development (TDD)**, and **small, frequent releases**. Best for **small, highly skilled teams needing top-tier code quality**. |
| **Lean Development** | Derived from **Toyota‚Äôs Lean Manufacturing**, it emphasizes **waste elimination, fast delivery, and continuous learning**. Helps **optimize software processes** and improve efficiency. |

## **üìå Software Estimation Techniques**  

| **Estimation Method** | **Description** |
|----------------------|---------------|
| **COCOMO (Constructive Cost Model)** | A **mathematical model** that estimates development effort based on **Lines of Code (LOC)** and project complexity. Best for **large, structured projects** in traditional environments. |
| **Function Point Analysis (FPA)** | Measures software **size and complexity** based on **user functions** instead of LOC. Useful for **business applications and cross-platform projects**. |
| **Planning Poker** | An Agile estimation technique where **team members independently assign effort estimates** using **Fibonacci numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 8‚Ä¶)**, then discuss and reach a consensus. Helps **reduce bias in team estimation**. |
| **T-Shirt Sizing** | A quick estimation method where tasks are categorized as **Small (S), Medium (M), Large (L), Extra Large (XL)** based on complexity. Useful for **early-stage project estimation**. |
| **Wideband Delphi** | A technique where **experts independently estimate effort**, results are aggregated anonymously, then revised in multiple rounds until consensus is reached. Best for **complex projects requiring expert judgment**. |

## **üìå Testing Approaches**  

| **Testing Type** | **Description** |
|-----------------|---------------|
| **Unit Testing** | Tests **individual components or functions** in isolation. Helps detect bugs early and is commonly used in **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**. |
| **Integration Testing** | Ensures that multiple **modules work together correctly**. Helps detect **interface errors between components**. |
| **System Testing** | Tests the **entire system** to verify if it meets the requirements (functional and non-functional). Focuses on **end-to-end validation**. |
| **Acceptance Testing** | Performed by **clients/users** to determine if the system **meets business needs** before deployment. |
| **Blackbox Testing** | Tests the software **without looking at internal code structure**. Focuses only on **input-output behavior**. |
| **Whitebox Testing** | Examines the **internal logic and code paths** to ensure correctness. Used by **developers for debugging and optimization**. |
| **Model-Based Testing (MBT)** | Uses **system models (e.g., flowcharts, state machines) to generate test cases automatically**. Best for **complex systems with predefined logic**. |

## **üìå Test Automation & Mocking**  

| **Technique** | **Description** |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Test Doubles (Mocking, Stubbing, Fakes, Dummies)** | Fake objects that **replace real dependencies** during testing. Used to isolate **System Under Test (SUT)**. |
| **Robot Framework** | A **keyword-driven test automation tool** for **Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD)**. Supports multiple languages (Python, Java, Selenium). |

## **üìå Lean Development: Waste Elimination Strategies**  

| **Lean Principle** | **Description** |
|------------------|---------------|
| **Eliminate Waste** | Remove **non-value activities** like unnecessary features, rework, delays, and excessive documentation. |
| **Amplify Learning** | Encourage **continuous feedback** through **prototypes, testing, and retrospectives**. |
| **Decide as Late as Possible** | Delay major decisions until **all relevant data is available**. |
| **Deliver as Fast as Possible** | Focus on **speed to market** with **short iterations & quick feedback loops**. |
| **Empower the Team** | Give **decision-making power** to developers rather than relying on strict management. |
| **Build Integrity In** | Ensure **long-term maintainability** by focusing on **quality, refactoring, and continuous integration**. |
| **See the Whole** | Consider **the entire system**, not just individual parts, to avoid inefficiencies. |

| **Scrum** | Best for **structured teams** working in **fixed-length iterations (Sprints)**. Provides **predictability & clear roles**. |
| **Kanban** | Ideal for **continuous work environments** like **DevOps, support teams, and maintenance**. No fixed iterations. |
| **XP (Extreme Programming)** | Best for **high-quality software development with test-driven development (TDD), pair programming, and continuous feedback**. |
| **Lean** | Focuses on **maximizing efficiency, reducing waste, and delivering fast**. Best for **optimizing workflows**. |
