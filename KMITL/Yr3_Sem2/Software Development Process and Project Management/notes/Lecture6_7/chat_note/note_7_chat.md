### **Summary of Lecture 7: Scrum**  

This lecture covers **Scrum**, an **Agile project management framework** that emphasizes **flexibility, teamwork, and iterative development**. It also introduces **LeSS (Large-Scale Scrum)** for managing large projects with multiple teams.

## **What is Scrum?**  

🔹 **Definition**  
Scrum is an **Agile software development framework** that focuses on **short iterations (Sprints)**, **team collaboration**, and **continuous feedback**.  

🔹 **Why Scrum?**  
- Traditional software development follows a **relay race model** (sequential phases).  
- Scrum follows a **rugby-like approach**, where the team moves **together, adapting to changes dynamically**.  

🔹 **Key Characteristics**  
✅ **Iterative & Incremental** – Develops software in small cycles.  
✅ **Self-organizing teams** – No strict hierarchy; the team decides how to do the work.  
✅ **Customer involvement** – Constant feedback and prioritization.  
✅ **Minimal documentation** – Focuses on **working software** instead of heavy paperwork.

## **Scrum Components**  

### **1️⃣ Scrum Roles**  
| **Role** | **Responsibilities** |
|---------|------------------|
| **Product Owner** | Defines & prioritizes the backlog, represents the customer. |
| **Scrum Master** | Facilitates the Scrum process, removes obstacles, ensures Agile principles. |
| **Scrum Team** | Developers, testers, designers (5–9 people), self-organizing, cross-functional. |

### **2️⃣ Scrum Artifacts**  
📌 **Product Backlog** – A **prioritized list** of features and tasks, managed by the **Product Owner**.  
📌 **Sprint Backlog** – A subset of the **Product Backlog**, selected for a **Sprint** (iteration).  
📌 **Product Increment** – A **working version** of the product at the end of each Sprint.  
📌 **Burndown Chart** – A graph showing **remaining work** over time.  

✅ **Product Backlog Refinement (PBR)** – The process of revising and reprioritizing the Product Backlog **during the project**.  

---

### **3️⃣ Scrum Activities (Meetings)**  

🔹 **Sprint Planning Meeting**  
- The team selects **which backlog items** to complete in the Sprint.  

🔹 **Daily Scrum (Daily Stand-up)**  
- A **15-minute** meeting where the team **discusses progress, obstacles, and plans for the day**.  

🔹 **Sprint Review**  
- A **demo** of the completed work to **stakeholders**.  

🔹 **Sprint Retrospective**  
- The team **reflects on the Sprint** and **identifies improvements**.  

📌 **(Optional) Product Backlog Refinement**  
- Adjusts backlog **based on feedback & evolving requirements**.  

---

## **Scrum Workflow**  

1️⃣ **Product Owner creates Product Backlog**.  
2️⃣ **Sprint Planning** – Team selects backlog items for the Sprint.  
3️⃣ **Sprint Execution** – Team works on tasks, with **Daily Scrums** for coordination.  
4️⃣ **Sprint Review** – Demonstrate completed work.  
5️⃣ **Sprint Retrospective** – Analyze what went well & what can improve.  
6️⃣ **Repeat the cycle for the next Sprint**.

## **LeSS (Large-Scale Scrum)**  

🔹 **What is LeSS?**  
- A **scaled-up version of Scrum** for **large projects** with multiple teams.  
- Introduced by **Craig Larman & Bas Vodde (2005)**.  

🔹 **How LeSS Works?**  
✅ **One Product Backlog** for all teams.  
✅ **One Product Owner** manages the backlog.  
✅ **Multiple teams working in the same Sprint**.  
✅ **One Definition of Done (DoD) for all teams**.  
✅ Teams coordinate but **remain cross-functional** (not specialized teams).  

🔹 **LeSS Process**  
- **Sprint Planning 1** – Teams collectively choose backlog items.  
- **Sprint Planning 2** – Each team creates their own development plan.  
- **Daily Scrum** – Each team meets daily; members can join other teams' meetings.  
- **Sprint Review** – All teams **present their work together** in a joint session.  
- **Overall Retrospective** – Scrum Masters, PO, and team reps discuss **improvements**.

## **Final Takeaways**  

✅ **Scrum is best for projects with changing requirements**.  
✅ **Encourages teamwork, transparency, and frequent feedback**.  
✅ **Minimal documentation, fast-paced delivery**.  
✅ **LeSS helps scale Scrum for large teams**.
