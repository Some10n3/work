### 9 women still needs 9 months to give birth
##### Adding more people does not always help
> Explain to the customer that even if they make other team come help us, some tasks still can't be done faster
|
> Some works require other works to be done before starting, extra assigned people will just sit there and have nothing to do

### Manday : 1 man day is an amount of work 1 man can do in a day
> 5 days til schedule doesn't mean 5 man days, might be more or less

### Person month / man day is the main cost of the project, since it relates to the dev's salary, which is the main cost of the project.

> If they don't like your estimated price and say other guy can do it heaper, say no. Cuz u already calculate the price you can survive. If the price is bad, you can't survive

## If your cost is 100k, charge 400k
- charge more profit to survive in the future
- cost for future no cashflow
- cost for no time to learn more stuffs
- You need to hold some cash all time to survive

> **if they pay 50% first and 50% when job is done, your can't operate on the second half, and if the project is cancled and you don't get the other half, you get no money**

- Sometimes when customer don't pay up, you need to have cash in buffer, or else you can't pay your employees, can't maintain the office.

### Less man day : charge more
- cost of finishing faster than other company
