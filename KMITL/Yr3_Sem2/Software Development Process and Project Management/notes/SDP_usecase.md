### **Comparison of Software Development Models and Methods**  

Here is a structured comparison of **all key concepts** from the **11 lectures**, categorized into **development models, Agile methodologies, estimation techniques, testing approaches, and lean principles**.

## **üìå Software Development Models**  
| **Model** | **Best Used When‚Ä¶** | **Not Suitable When‚Ä¶** |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Waterfall** | Requirements are **fixed & well-defined**. Large projects with **low uncertainty**. | Requirements are **likely to change**. Late discovery of issues. |
| **V-Model** | **Strict quality control** is needed. **Safety-critical systems** (e.g., medical, aviation). | No flexibility for changes. Slow iteration speed. |
| **Unified Process (UP)** | Large projects needing **structured yet iterative** development. | Small, simple projects (too complex). |
| **Spiral Model** | High-risk projects requiring **continuous risk evaluation**. | Simple, small projects. |
| **Prototyping** | Exploring new ideas or **validating requirements** before full development. | Long-term projects needing structured workflow. |
| **Agile (Scrum/Kanban/XP)** | Requirements **change frequently**. Need **fast iterations & customer feedback**. | Large, highly regulated projects needing strict documentation. |
| **RAD (Rapid Application Development)** | Fast-paced projects needing **quick user feedback**. | Complex, long-term projects with multiple dependencies. |

## **üìå Agile Methodologies**  
| **Method** | **Best For‚Ä¶** | **Not Suitable For‚Ä¶** |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| **Scrum** | **Product development**, structured sprints, predictable work cycles. | Support/maintenance work (rigid sprint cycles). |
| **Kanban** | **Continuous workflow** (e.g., bug fixes, DevOps, customer support). | Projects needing **fixed-length iterations**. |
| **Scrumban** | Teams transitioning from Scrum to Kanban or **long-term projects with evolving scope**. | Teams needing **strict sprints** (Kanban is more flexible). |
| **Extreme Programming (XP)** | High-quality code & collaboration, **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**. | Large teams with **low developer interaction**. |
| **Lean Development** | **Optimizing workflows** to remove waste and speed up delivery. | Bureaucratic or **heavily regulated environments**. |

## **üìå Software Estimation Techniques**  
| **Estimation Method** | **Best Used When‚Ä¶** | **Not Suitable When‚Ä¶** |
|----------------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| **COCOMO (LOC-based)** | Large **Waterfall projects**, legacy systems. | Agile projects (LOC is unpredictable). |
| **Function Point Analysis (FPA)** | **Business applications**, cross-language comparisons. | Systems where functionality is unclear. |
| **Planning Poker** | **Agile teams** estimating effort collaboratively. | Large projects needing historical data. |
| **T-Shirt Sizing** | Quick high-level effort estimates. | Highly detailed cost estimations. |
| **Wideband Delphi** | Expert-based estimation **reducing bias**. | Teams lacking experienced members. |

---

## **üìå Testing Approaches**  
| **Testing Type** | **Best For‚Ä¶** | **Not Suitable When‚Ä¶** |
|-----------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Unit Testing** | Testing **individual functions** (TDD, XP). | End-to-end system validation. |
| **Integration Testing** | Ensuring **multiple modules work together**. | Standalone function validation. |
| **System Testing** | Checking if the full system **meets requirements**. | Isolated component testing. |
| **Acceptance Testing** | **Client validation** before deployment. | Internal development testing. |
| **Blackbox Testing** | Ensuring functionality **without knowing internal code**. | Debugging internal logic. |
| **Whitebox Testing** | **Code-level testing** (ensuring logic correctness). | User experience or system validation. |
| **Model-Based Testing (MBT)** | **Early testing using system models**. | Rapid development without formal models. |

---

## **üìå Test Automation & Mocking**  
| **Technique** | **Best For‚Ä¶** | **Not Suitable When‚Ä¶** |
|-------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Test Doubles (Mocking, Stubbing, Fakes)** | Isolating system components **during unit testing**. | Full-system integration tests. |
| **Robot Framework** | **Automated testing** for acceptance and regression testing. | Small manual test cases. |

---

## **üìå Lean Development: Waste Elimination Strategies**  
| **Lean Principle** | **Best Used When‚Ä¶** | **Not Suitable When‚Ä¶** |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Eliminate Waste** | Identifying & removing **non-value activities**. | Strict compliance projects needing documentation. |
| **Amplify Learning** | Fast-paced teams needing **continuous improvement**. | Stable projects with **fixed, unchanging scope**. |
| **Decide Late** | Systems with **high uncertainty & evolving requirements**. | Fixed, **fully defined** projects. |
| **Deliver Fast** | **Competitive industries** where speed matters. | Government or **heavily regulated projects**. |
| **Empower the Team** | **Agile teams** where self-organization is encouraged. | Bureaucratic **hierarchical teams**. |
| **Build Integrity In** | Systems needing **long-term maintainability**. | One-time use projects. |
| **See the Whole** | Large systems with **multiple teams & integrations**. | Small projects with **few dependencies**. |

## **üìå When to Use Scrum vs. Kanban vs. XP vs. Lean**  
| **Method** | **Best For‚Ä¶** | **When to Avoid** |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| **Scrum** | **Product teams, structured work**, predictable sprints. | Support work, high uncertainty. |
| **Kanban** | **Continuous workflows**, DevOps, customer support. | When fixed-length iterations are needed. |
| **XP (Extreme Programming)** | **High-quality code, pair programming, TDD**. | Large teams where collaboration is low. |
| **Lean** | **Maximizing efficiency, reducing waste**. | Compliance-heavy, **regulated industries**. |
