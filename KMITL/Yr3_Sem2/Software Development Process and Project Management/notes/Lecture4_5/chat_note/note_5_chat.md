### **Summary of Lecture 5: User Stories and Agile Estimation**  

This lecture covers **User Stories** (a key requirement technique in Agile) and **Agile Estimation** methods used for project planning. Agile replaces **heavy documentation** with **collaborative, flexible, and fast-paced development**, and these methods help teams manage uncertainty efficiently.

## **User Stories: Capturing Requirements in Agile**  

🔹 **What is a User Story?**  
A **short, simple** description of a feature **from a user’s perspective**:  
➡ **Format:**  
> "As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason]."  
> Example: *"As an astronaut, I want to align my ship so that I can park at the space station."*  

🔹 **Why use User Stories?**  
- Users **don’t think in formal models** (like Use Cases).  
- Stories make requirements **easy to understand and prioritize**.  
- Helps **developers focus on user needs** rather than just system behavior.  

🔹 **User Stories vs. Use Cases vs. Scenarios**  
| Feature | **User Story** | **Use Case** | **Scenario** |
|---------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Definition** | Brief statement of user need | Detailed step-by-step interaction | Sequence of user actions |
| **Level of Detail** | Minimal | Comprehensive | Sequential flow |
| **Purpose** | Defines a goal | Specifies system behavior | Describes a situation |

## **Emergent Requirements & Epics**  

🔹 **Emergent Requirements** – **New requirements** that appear during development:  
- **Unforeseen problems** arise.  
- **New ideas** get introduced.  
- Some features were **overlooked** in initial planning.  

🔹 **Solution? Use Epics**  
- **Epics = Big User Stories** that need to be **broken down later**.  
- Instead of defining **every tiny detail** upfront, define **large goals** first.  
- Example **Epic**: "Land on the moon" → Broken into **smaller stories** like "Align spaceship," "Deploy landing gear," etc.

## **Agile Estimation: Predicting Effort Without Overplanning**  

### 🔹 **What is Agile Estimation?**  
- A **flexible**, **team-driven** way to estimate effort in Agile projects.  
- Focuses on **relative size**, not absolute time (since software development is unpredictable).  
- Encourages **team collaboration** and reduces misunderstandings.  

🔹 **Why Use Agile Estimation?**  
✅ Helps teams **plan iterations** and **release schedules**.  
✅ Avoids **over-detailed planning**, which becomes **obsolete** when changes occur.  
✅ Provides a **shared team understanding** of effort required.

## **Agile Estimation Methods**  

### **1️⃣ Planning Poker** 🃏 (Most Common)  
- **How it works:**  
  1. Each team member **privately** selects an estimation card.  
  2. Cards are revealed **at the same time** (to prevent bias).  
  3. If estimates **differ widely**, team discusses and **re-estimates**.  
- **Uses Fibonacci numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21…)** because larger tasks have more uncertainty.

### **2️⃣ T-Shirt Sizing 👕** (Quick & Simple)  
- Tasks are categorized into **Small (S), Medium (M), Large (L), Extra Large (XL)** sizes.  
- No exact time estimate—just a rough effort comparison.  
- Works well for **high-level estimation** before breaking tasks down.  

📌 **Example Mapping:**  
| T-Shirt Size | Estimated Effort |
|-------------|----------------|
| **S** | 1-2 days |
| **M** | 3-4 days |
| **L** | 5-6 days |
| **XL** | 7+ days (needs breaking down) |

### **3️⃣ Wideband Delphi 🏛️**  
- Each expert **independently** estimates effort.  
- Estimates are collected **anonymously**.  
- Facilitator **reveals results** → Discussion happens → New estimates are made until consensus is reached.  

---

### **4️⃣ Affinity Estimating**  
- **Similar tasks** are **grouped together** and estimated **as a batch**.  
- Helps estimate **large backlogs** efficiently.  

---

### **5️⃣ Dot Voting** 🔴🔵  
- **Each team member votes** for tasks they think are most important.  
- **The most voted items** are prioritized first.  

---

## **Cognitive Bias: Anchoring Bias**  
⚠ **Anchoring Bias** = People tend to **base their estimates on the first number they hear** (even if it’s wrong).  

Example:  
👨‍💻 Developer 1: "I think this task takes **30 days**."  
👩‍💻 Other developers **adjust their estimates around 30 days**, even if **the real effort is much less**.  

🔹 **How Agile prevents this?**  
✅ **Planning Poker forces silent estimation first** before discussion.  
✅ **Using relative estimation** (S, M, L) avoids attachment to exact numbers.

## **Final Takeaways**  
🔹 **User Stories = Simple, user-focused requirement descriptions** (No complex models).  
🔹 **Emergent requirements exist, so Agile embraces flexibility**.  
🔹 **Agile Estimation is not about accuracy—it’s about shared team understanding**.  
🔹 **Methods like Planning Poker & T-Shirt Sizing help avoid overplanning**.  
🔹 **Avoid cognitive biases (e.g., Anchoring Bias) by forcing independent estimation first**.
