### **Summary of Lecture 4: Agile Software Development**  

This lecture covers **Agile Software Development**, its philosophy, principles, and different Agile methodologies. Agile was introduced as an alternative to **traditional "heavy" software processes** (e.g., Waterfall, Unified Process) to be more adaptable to **changing requirements** and **faster delivery cycles**.  

---

## **What is Agile? Why "Go Agile"?**  
- Traditional software development models (e.g., Waterfall, UP) are **rigid** and **plan-heavy**.  
- Agile was created to handle **uncertain and changing requirements** better.  
- In **2001**, the **Agile Alliance** introduced the **Agile Manifesto**, which defines Agile values.  

---

## **Agile Manifesto: Core Values**  
Agile emphasizes **flexibility, collaboration, and working software** over rigid processes.  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Individuals & interactions** over **processes & tools**  
   - Teams should be **self-organized and adaptable** rather than follow strict processes.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Working software** over **comprehensive documentation**  
   - Deliver **actual software** frequently, rather than spending too much time on planning documents.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Customer collaboration** over **contract negotiation**  
   - Clients and developers **work together continuously** instead of just negotiating requirements once.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Responding to change** over **following a plan**  
   - Agile **embraces change**, even late in development, instead of sticking to a rigid plan.  

---

## **Agile Levels: Key Components**  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Agile Values** ‚Äì The **philosophy** behind Agile (from the manifesto).  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Agile Principles** ‚Äì **Strategies** that define how Agile is implemented.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Agile Methods** ‚Äì Specific **frameworks** (e.g., Scrum, XP, RAD).  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Agile Practices** ‚Äì **Techniques** used within Agile (e.g., stand-up meetings, product backlogs).  

---

## **Agile Principles (Key Ideas)**  
üìå **Deliver working software frequently** (every **1‚Äì6 weeks**).  
üìå **Embrace change**, even late in development.  
üìå **Close collaboration** between developers and business teams.  
üìå **Face-to-face communication** is preferred over emails/docs.  
üìå **Simplicity** ‚Äì Do the **minimum work** required for success.  
üìå **Self-organizing teams** make the best decisions.  
üìå Regularly **reflect & adjust** for continuous improvement.

## **Agile Methods: How Agile is Implemented**  
Different Agile frameworks apply Agile principles in **different ways**.  

| **Agile Manifesto Value** | **Agile Techniques** |
|-------------------------|---------------------|
| **Individuals & interactions** | Small teams, pair programming, shared code ownership |
| **Working software** | Test-driven development, refactoring |
| **Customer collaboration** | Customer representatives within the team |
| **Responding to change** | Continuous integration, frequent releases |

---

## **Agile Development Cycle**  
Instead of a **fixed design phase**, Agile follows **iterative cycles**:  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Obtain requirements** (for a small part of the project).  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Modify code and test** (implementing new requirements).  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Refactor** (clean and improve the codebase).  
4Ô∏è‚É£ Repeat the cycle for the next requirements.  

üí° **Key difference from UP**: Agile **does not** have a separate, explicit **design phase**‚Äîinstead, the design evolves through **refactoring** after each iteration.  

---

## **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**  
**MVP = The smallest possible version of a product that delivers value.**  
- Focuses only on **core functionalities** necessary for the product to work.  
- Anything that is **not essential** is removed to **deliver quickly**.  

üí° **Example:**  
- A **social media MVP** might only include **posting & viewing posts**, leaving out likes, comments, or profiles for later iterations.  

---

## **Rapid Application Development (RAD)**  
RAD is an **Agile-like** approach that focuses on **speed and user involvement**.  
- Created in **1991** by **James Martin**.  
- Uses **prototyping**, **small development teams**, and **automated tools**.  
- Works in **fixed time frames (Time Boxes)** instead of fixed scope.  

### **RAD Lifecycle**  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Requirement Planning** ‚Äì Gather & prioritize requirements using **Joint Requirement Planning (JRP)** workshops.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **User Design** ‚Äì Users work **directly with developers** to refine system design (**Joint Application Design - JAD**).  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Construction** ‚Äì A **SWAT (Skilled With Advanced Tools) team** rapidly builds multiple prototypes.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Cutover** ‚Äì **Testing, deployment, and training** take place.  

### **MoSCoW Prioritization** (Used in RAD)  
- **M**ust-have ‚Äì Essential features for the current iteration.  
- **S**hould-have ‚Äì Important but not mandatory features.  
- **C**ould-have ‚Äì Nice-to-have but not necessary.  
- **W**on't-have ‚Äì Features postponed for future versions.  

---

## **Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)**  
DSDM is an **Agile method** that evolved from **RAD**.  
- Uses **fixed time and resources** (Time Boxed like RAD).  
- Prioritizes requirements using **MoSCoW**.  
- **Iterative and incremental** like other Agile frameworks.  

### **DSDM Stages**  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Feasibility** ‚Äì Outline plan, check if Agile is suitable.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Business Study** ‚Äì High-level analysis of business needs.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Functional Model Iteration** ‚Äì Produce analysis models and functioning prototypes.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Design & Build Iteration** ‚Äì Integrate functional components into a working system.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ **Implementation** ‚Äì System testing and deployment.  

### **DSDM Best Practices**  
‚úÖ **Active user involvement** throughout development.  
‚úÖ **Empowered teams** make their own decisions.  
‚úÖ **Frequent deliveries** of working software.  
‚úÖ **Testing is integrated** into the development lifecycle.

## **Key Differences: Agile vs. Unified Process (UP) vs. Waterfall**  

| **Feature**            | **Waterfall** | **Unified Process (UP)** | **Agile** |
|----------------------|--------------|----------------|--------|
| **Flexibility** | Rigid, plan-heavy | Somewhat flexible (phased) | Highly flexible |
| **Iterations** | None | Structured iterations per phase | Short, continuous iterations |
| **User Involvement** | Mostly in requirement phase | Regular feedback per phase | Continuous collaboration |
| **Documentation** | Extensive upfront docs | Moderate docs per phase | Minimal, just enough docs |
| **Risk Management** | Late risk discovery | Risk-driven, assessed per phase | Adaptable, risks handled continuously |
| **Best For** | Large, **stable projects** | Large, **structured projects** | **Fast-changing, dynamic projects** |

---

## **Final Thoughts**  
üîπ **Agile is best for fast-moving, adaptable projects** where requirements change often.  
üîπ **Unified Process (UP) is structured but flexible**, making it better for large, **complex systems**.  
üîπ **Waterfall is only suitable for projects with stable and clear requirements** from the start.  

**If flexibility, collaboration, and speed matter ‚Üí Agile is the best approach.**
