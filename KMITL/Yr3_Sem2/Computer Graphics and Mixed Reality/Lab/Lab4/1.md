## 1.1  How does the Cube class define the vertices and triangles for a 3D cube? 
> In the Cube.py file, the Cube class inherits from the Mesh class and overrides the init method.
>
> The vertices list contains 8 tuples representing the coordinates of each vertex of the cube.
>
> The triangles list contains indices that define the connectivity of the vertices to form triangles. Each group of four numbers represents two triangles sharing an edge.

## 1.2  What is the role of the super().__init__() call in the Cube class?
> Initializing the inherited attributes from mesh class
>
> Passing the two lists to parent class's __init__
