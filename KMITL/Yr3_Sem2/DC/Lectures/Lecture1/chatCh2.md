### Summary of Chapter 2: System Models

This chapter explores system models used in distributed systems, focusing on architectural patterns, their components, and various ways systems handle communication and resource sharing.

---

### **Architectural Models**
- Concerned with the **placement of components** (tasks) and **communication patterns** between them.
- **Layered Software Architecture**:
  - **Platform**: The foundation providing interfaces for services to upper layers. It masks heterogeneity.
  - **Middleware**: Manages communication and resource sharing, offering building blocks for applications (e.g., remote method invocation).

---

### **Key Architectural Styles**
1. **Client-Server**:
   - The most common model where clients request services, and servers respond.
   - A server can act as a client to other servers (e.g., a web server querying a DNS server).
   - Services can be distributed across multiple servers to ensure consistency and performance.

2. **Proxy Servers and Caches**:
   - Proxy servers store frequently accessed data (e.g., web proxy caches), reducing latency and bandwidth usage.

3. **Peer-to-Peer**:
   - All processes have similar roles, enabling decentralized communication.
   - Used in interactive applications like online games or file-sharing networks (e.g., BitTorrent).

4. **Mobile Code**:
   - Programs (e.g., applets) are downloaded and executed on a client device for better interactivity, though with security risks.

5. **Mobile Agents**:
   - Programs travel across computers to perform tasks, reducing data transfer costs and allowing local resource usage.

6. **Network Computers**:
   - Operating systems and applications are downloaded from a remote server, minimizing local management needs.

7. **Thin Clients**:
   - Local systems display user interfaces while computations occur on a powerful remote server.
   - Examples include X-11 (UNIX) and Microsoft Virtual Desktop.

8. **Spontaneous Networking**:
   - Mobile devices adapt to new networks, discovering and using services automatically.
   - Challenges include maintaining privacy and security as devices interact across networks.

---

### **Highlights of Each Model**
- **Client-Server**: Efficiency and structured communication but dependent on server availability.
- **Peer-to-Peer**: High resilience and scalability; ideal for decentralized tasks.
- **Mobile Code & Agents**: Enhance interactivity and reduce network overhead; potential security vulnerabilities.
- **Spontaneous Networking**: Convenient for mobile users but requires robust reconfiguration, security, and privacy mechanisms.

This chapter demonstrates how various system models address the challenges of distributed systems, such as heterogeneity, scalability, and security, while ensuring efficient and user-friendly operations.

### Difference Between Mobile Code and Mobile Agent

#### **Mobile Code**
- **What it is**: A piece of code (like an applet or script) that is downloaded from a server to a client device and executed locally.
- **How it works**:
  - When a user interacts with a server (e.g., clicks a link on a webpage), the server sends the code to the client.
  - The code is executed locally on the client device to provide interactive functionality, like animations or forms in a browser.
- **Example**: Java Applets, JavaScript on web browsers.
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - Improves responsiveness by offloading computations to the client.
  - Limited to the client device that downloads it.
  - Security risks exist because the downloaded code could harm the local system if not properly sandboxed.

#### **Mobile Agent**
- **What it is**: A **running program** (including its code and state) that **moves autonomously** across computers in a network to perform tasks on behalf of a user or application.
- **How it works**:
  - An agent starts on one computer and, if needed, migrates to another computer in the network to continue executing its tasks.
  - It uses local resources at the destination computer to perform tasks, reducing the need for remote communication.
- **Example**: A mobile agent that collects data from multiple servers by moving between them, or one that installs updates on remote systems.
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - **Autonomous movement**: Unlike mobile code, it doesn’t stay on a single client device but moves across multiple systems.
  - Reduces network overhead by performing tasks locally rather than repeatedly sending data across the network.
  - Security risks are higher because agents interact with local resources, requiring strict access controls.

---

### **Key Difference**
- **Scope**: Mobile code runs locally on the client where it’s downloaded. Mobile agents are designed to travel across systems and execute tasks at each stop.
- **Purpose**: Mobile code improves interactivity for the user; mobile agents optimize resource use and reduce network dependency.

### Network Computers Explanation

Yes, your understanding is correct. **Network computers** are systems designed to reduce local complexity and management. They are connected to a network and rely on a remote server to provide essential services:

- **How it works**:
  - Instead of maintaining operating systems, applications, or files locally, these are downloaded as needed from a server.
  - The network computer may use a local disk as a temporary cache but doesn't permanently store software or user data.

- **Key Idea**:
  - The server centralizes management and updates, simplifying IT maintenance.
  - Users can move between computers and access the same files or services, as everything is managed remotely.

- **Examples**:
  - Thin clients like Citrix environments.
  - Chromebooks, where most services are cloud-based.

### **Conclusion**
- **Mobile agents** travel across computers to perform distributed tasks, while **mobile code** runs on a single client device.

Exactly! **Network computers** operate on a similar principle to remote desktop tools like **AnyDesk** or **RustDesk**, but with a few distinctions:

---

### **Network Computers vs. Remote Desktop (AnyDesk/RustDesk)**

#### **Similarities**:
1. **Centralized Computing**:
   - Your local computer (thin client) is primarily a tool to connect to a remote system.
   - Most of the heavy lifting—data processing, storage, or application execution—happens on the remote system (server).
2. **Minimal Local Resources**:
   - The local computer requires only basic hardware and software to establish the connection and display output.
3. **User Experience**:
   - You interact with the remote system as if you’re using it directly.

---

#### **Differences**:
1. **Connection Type**:
   - **Remote Desktop**: You're remotely controlling another existing computer (desktop or server). It’s like “borrowing” the remote PC’s entire operating system and environment.
   - **Network Computers**: The system is designed from the ground up to rely on a server for its OS, applications, and data. Your local device might not even store an OS—it boots over the network.

2. **Purpose**:
   - **Remote Desktop**: Primarily for accessing an existing PC remotely, like troubleshooting, accessing files, or running software not installed locally.
   - **Network Computers**: Aimed at reducing local device management by centralizing everything, often for cost and maintenance benefits.

3. **Caching**:
   - In a **network computer**, the local device might cache recently used files or software to improve speed and work offline temporarily.
   - **Remote desktop tools** don’t cache files; they require an active connection.

---

### **Example of Network Computers**
- **Thin Clients in Offices**: Employees use thin clients to connect to a central server. All their work—email, document editing, and even running applications—is done on the server, not locally.
- **Cloud Workstations**: Services like Google Chromebooks or Amazon WorkSpaces function as network computers, where most operations are cloud-based.

---

### **Conclusion**
You can think of network computers as a **dedicated system for connecting to a server** where all the actual work happens, similar to AnyDesk or RustDesk. However, network computers are purpose-built for this role, often designed for **scalability, maintenance efficiency, and centralized management**, unlike general remote desktop tools.

### **Mobile Agent Example**

To visualize **mobile agents**, imagine this scenario:

#### **Use Case: Data Collection Across Multiple Servers**
- A company has several databases located in different cities (e.g., New York, London, Tokyo).
- Instead of retrieving data remotely (which might involve high network traffic), a **mobile agent** is deployed.

#### How It Works:
1. The mobile agent starts on a central computer in New York.
2. It moves to the database server in London, performs a query, and gathers the data locally.
3. It then travels to Tokyo, queries the database there, and adds the results to its data collection.
4. Finally, the agent returns to New York with the complete set of data.

#### **Benefits**:
- **Reduced Network Overhead**: Instead of transferring massive amounts of data across the network, only the agent (small in size) moves.
- **Local Efficiency**: The agent processes and filters data locally on each server, sending back only the results.

#### **Another Example: Software Update Deployment**
- An IT team wants to update a specific software package across 1,000 computers in a network.
- A mobile agent is programmed to:
  1. Visit each computer in the network.
  2. Check the current software version.
  3. Install updates if necessary.
- The agent moves autonomously between machines, completing the task without human intervention.

### **Key Visualization of a Mobile Agent**
Think of a mobile agent as a **traveler** carrying a task (code and data). It "visits" systems in the network, performs its task locally at each stop, and carries the results or updates back home. 

This contrasts with remote communication, where you stay in one place and repeatedly send requests to all the systems. Mobile agents act like autonomous helpers, **going where the work is** instead of calling systems to you.
