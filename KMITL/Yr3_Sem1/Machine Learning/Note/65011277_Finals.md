## 1. Can you classify between **supervised** and **unsupervised** learning and also between **generative** and **discriminative** of all classical machine learning models that we have been studying in the class, except for shallow neural networks, and summarize in **what scenarios they are most effective**?

Write a JUPYTER Python program using “any classical machine learning model or a shallow neural network that we have been studying in the class“ together with an appropriate preprocessing model to train a data set of MNIST sound. Explain the program step by step. The data file is attached to the exam folder in the MSTEAMs assignment.
