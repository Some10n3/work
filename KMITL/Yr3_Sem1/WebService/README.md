## Multi Repository

### Pros
- `Security` Assign access to specific folder in specific repo to each team. If one user's github account got hacked, the attacker will only have access to that folder and not the whole repository. Also use branching for each team and commits will only be accepted by the team leader to ensure the hacked accounts can't modify the repository. Each team will have a separate master branch in the main repository (They can branch further but can't access branches rooted from other's branches)
